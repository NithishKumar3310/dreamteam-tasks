								$ BANDIT 1-20 $





LEVEL 0: * LEARN SSH COMMAND AND MAKE THE HOST CONNECTION THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD WAS GIVEN DIRECTLY LEVEL 0-1: * LEARNT THE CD,LS,CAT,FILE,DU,FIND COMMANDS ,USED 'ls -a' to list out all the directory and files ,next there was an info the password is in readme.md file ,so i used the command "cat readme.md" to open the file and find the PASSWORD "ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If" and used the commmand to exit to leave and used " ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" to move to the next tasks level 1-2: * The commands learned before is enough but we need to learn the extensions of the cat command ,here the the password is stored in dashed file so the terminal will get confused soo we want to use "cat ./-" to denote as in the present directory and the filename is "-" and i got the PASSWORD "263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx" then move to the NEXT LEVEL using "ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" level 2-3: * I have used "ls-la" to list out all the files with extended details then as the filename contained both "spaces" and special character "-" it will definetly confuse the terminal so we have used the command "" cat -- "--spaces in this filename--" ""
here the first -- denotes that the next charcters are the part of the filename and no other keyword used and task the next entire string as a filename and i got the PASSWORD "MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx" FOR THE NEXT LEVEL and used "ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" to move next level level 3-4: * I have used "ls-la" to list out all the files with extended deatails there was a directory called "inhere" i used cd inhere to open it and again used "ls -al" to list out then i got to know that there is a file "...Hiding-From-You" as mentioned in the task so i used " cat -- "...Hiding-From-You" " to open the file the concept was learned in the last task I GOT THE PASSWORD "2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ" and used "ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" to move to the next task level 4-5: * I have used ls -al to list out and used cd-inhere to move to the directory as given then a new concept "file ./*" which tells the type of a file and there was a info as ASCII TEXT in the file 07 and rest was a data so i opened the file 07 and got the password "4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw" then used "ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" to move to the next task level 5-6: * I have used ls -al to list out and used cd-inhere to move to the directory as given i have learnt to use 'find' command to search a file with the conditons given i have used the commad "find . -type f -size 1033c" to find a file with size of 1033 bytes where c- prefix of bytes -type f denotes the file and i got the path that the file is present in maybehere07 and .file2 i have used "cd maybehere07" and cat .file2 AND GOT THE PASSWORD "HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG" THEN USED "ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" TO MOVE TO THE NEXT LEVEL "

level 6-7: here there is no specific directory mentioned so we want to search from the "root directory" i have learned the extensions of the find command which took hours to understand that single step i have used / instead . to search in root and mentioned the cases as given and the important step 2>/dev/null which was quit hard to understand when we use the command without this there will be lots of permission denied message to redirect the error message we use "2>" dev/null/ command is used to dissapper any message ,in this case the error message (permission denied messages) is dissappered all as combined i have used the command "find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null" and got the path and used cat command to read it and GOT THE PASSWORD "morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj" and used "ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" to move on to the next task level 7-8: *here also there is no specific directory mentioned the file name is given so i have used the command " find / -type f -iname "data.txt" 2>/dev/null " and listed few files which named data.txt,then i used cat command and found there are several no of lines so i started to learn grep command i have learned grep command to find a specific line in the file and used " grep "millionth" data.txt" to find the specific line and i got the PASSWORD "dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc" and used "ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" to move to the next level level 8-9: *there is no specific directory mentioned the file name was given a data.txt so i used the command "find / -type f -iname "data.txt" 2>/dev/null" there were some files listed out there was condition given as the password line was the only line which doesnt have a duplicate line i learnt sort command with extensions and used the command " sort data.txt | uniq -u " and GOT THE PASSWORD "4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM" AND USED "ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" to move the next level level 9-10: * *there is no specific directory mentioned
the file name was given a data.txt so i used the command "find / -type f -iname "data.txt" 2>/dev/null" there were some files listed out then learned about string command ,it is used to extract only the human readble txt in the file i used "strings data.txt" then there where multiple lines ,so i added condotion using grep command the final command i used is "strings data.txt | grep "==" " then I GOT THE PASSWORD "FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey" and used "ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" to move to the next level level 10-11: * *there is no specific directory mentioned the file name was given a data.txt so i used the command "find / -type f -iname "data.txt" 2>/dev/null" there were some files listed out i have learned about base64 ,it encodes a binary data into a text ,mostly it will end by "==" or without any special characters then i have used " cat data.txt" and opend the file ,there was a base64 code ending with == , i have used the base64 command to convert into normal text ,the exact command was "base64 -d data.txt" AND I GOT THE PASSWORD "dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr" AND USED "ssh bandit11@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" TO MOVE TO THE NEXT TASK level 11-12: * there is no specific directory mentioned the file name was given a data.txt so i used the command "find / -type f -iname "data.txt" 2>/dev/null" there were some files listed out then i have used " cat data.txt" and opend the file and there was an some unmeanigfull string as mentioned in the task the string was 13 character displaced i learned about the the command "tr" which converts the string according to the condition given by the user the command i used is "cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'" where the "A-Za-z" denotes both upper and lower case and "N-ZA-Mn-za-m" this denotes 13 characters has been shifted AND I GOT THE PASSWORD "7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4" AND USED "ssh bandit12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" to move to the next level level 12-13: In this level, no specific directory was mentioned, so I created a temporary working directory using mktemp -d and moved into it. I then copied the data.txt file into this directory. When I opened the file, it looked like a hexdump, so I learned about the xxd command which converts hexdump back into binary. I used xxd -r data.txt > newfile to reverse it. After that, I checked the file type using the file command, and it showed that the file was compressed. Since it was repeatedly compressed in different formats such as gzip, bzip2, and tar, I had to rename the file xtension each time (e.g., .gz, .bz2, .tar) and then use the correct command to extract it: gunzip for gzip, bzip2 -d for bzip2, and tar -xf or tar archives. I repeated this process of checking with file, renaming, and extracting multiple times until I finally got a plain ASCII text file. using cat on this file revealed the password, and with that, I connected to the next level using ssh bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 level 13-14: * i have used ls -a to list out all the items , i found something as sshkey.private and used cat to open and i got permission denied and i learned about 'chmod' command which used to change the permision , the commmand i used is" chmod 600sshkey.private" where chmod used to change the permission , 6 - denotes permission for read and write ,0- denotes no permission for other group and other user and i got the key "ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost -p 2220" inside and used this key to login the bandit14 to find the password there was mentioned as the password is in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 so i have used cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 to find the password and i got the PASSWORD "MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS" and used "ssh bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" to move on the next level level 14-15: in this task they asked to connect to a different port and on a local host i learnt about the command netcat "nc" which is used to transfer the data along the ports the command i used is "nc localhost 30000" and submitted the previous password and GOT THE NEW PASSWORD "8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo" and used "ssh bandit15@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" to move to the next task level 15-16: in this task they asked to connect to a different port and on a local host and enter the password of the previous task which gives the next password i have tried to connect with nc but it didnt work because there are some encryptions so we wanted to use openssl s_client i learnt about the command the used this "openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001" the connect to the severe with all the encryption and i have entered the password of the 15 taks and GOT THE NEW PASSWORD "kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx" AND USED "ssh bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" to login the next level level 16-17: In this level, the task was to find which port (between 31000 and 32000) was running a service that would accept the current password and return the next one. To start, I used the nmap command nmap -p31000-32000 localhost to scan the port range. This showed me which ports were open and listening. Next, I tested the open ports with openssl s_client -connect localhost: to check which one was speaking SSL/TLS. Some ports rejected the connection or gave errors like “unexpected message,” but when I connected to port 31518, it successfully established a TLS connection. Inside this session, I pasted the current password for Bandit16, and the server responded by giving me the next password. The password I retrieved was kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx, which I then used to log into Bandit17 with the command ssh -i bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p I WAS DIRECTLY TOOK IN BANDIT17 level 17-18: I USED LS -A TO LIST OUT THERE IS AN INFO THAT THE PASSWORD IS THE LINE WHICH IS THE ONLY LINE DIFFERNT IN PASSWORD.OLD AND PASSWORDS.NE I USED DIFF COMMAND THE EXACT COMMAND WAS "diff passwords.old passwords.new" AND GOT THE PASSWORD "x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO" USED "ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" TO MOVE TO NEXT LEVEL level 18-19: I HAVE SEEN THE "BYE BYE !" THEN I MEANS I HAVE COMPLETED THE TASK SUCCESSFULLY NOW IM NOVING TO THE TASK BANDIT19 level 19-20: i have used ls -a to list out all the items then i have use "./bandit20-do" to to read instruction without any arguments and used "./bandit20-do id" to find the id and used "./bandit20-do /bin/cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20" to read the password for the next level an used "ssh bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" to move the next level

		" succesfully completed upto level 20 "

REVIEW: * first ten tasks were quit easy * but the next 8 bit hard and consumed more time ,literally a day was spent on the 8 tasks *OVERALL, The Task was more intresting and difficult
