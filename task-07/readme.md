I HAVE LEARNT HTML AND CSS THROUGH YOUTUBE 
I HAVE REFERED "ERROR MAKES CLEVER" Channel
it took few hours to learn the HTML 
and i have followed with sample project which was given by him it was a quite easy one 
to create a structure of the "perfumy" (a perfume product based web)  
in that i have used my creativity 
and got confused , learnt and solved , it was quite intresting 
then i have learnt CSS from the same channel 
it was easy 
and designed the web which i created while learning HTML

THEN I STARTED TO CREATE THE WEB "THE NINEFOLD PATH"
I HAVE USED THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH I GATHERED BEFORE AND MADE IN A SIMPLE AND A CLASSY BLACK AND WHITE THEME
